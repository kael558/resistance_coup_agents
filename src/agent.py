def game_explanation():
    return """Hereâ€™s an extremely brief summary of the game *Coup*, highlighting the main actions, cards, and challenge-counter mechanics:

### Cards (Roles) with Actions and Blocks
1. **Duke**: Takes 3 coins from the treasury with TAX (not blockable), can block foreign aid action.
2. **Assassin**: Pays 3 coins to assassinate another player's character.
3. **Captain**: Steals 2 coins from another player, can block stealing.
4. **Ambassador**: Draws 2 cards to swap with court deck, can block stealing.
5. **Contessa**: Can block assassination.

### Additional Actions
- **Income**: Take 1 coin.
- **Foreign Aid**: Take 2 coins from the treasury (can be blocked by Duke).
- **Coup**: Pay 7 coins to launch a coup against another player, forcing them to lose an influence. This action cannot be blocked or challenged.

### Challenge
- If a player believes another player does not have the card they claim to be using, they can challenge them. A failed challenge results in the challenger losing an influence; a successful challenge results in the challenged player losing an influence.

### Counteractions
- Certain cards block specific actions (e.g., Duke blocks Foreign Aid, Captain and Ambassador block stealing, Contessa blocks assassination).

### Winning the Game
Be the last player with influence (cards) remaining to win the game."""

In your communications, you can choose to use SPEECH, THOUGHT, or ACTION.
- Use 'SPEECH:' to communicate anything to other players.
- Use 'THOUGHT:' to reflect on your best course of action that maximizes your chances of winning, what cards you think others have, how you should respond to other players, etc.
- Use 'ACTION:' to make a strategic move, specifying the action and the target player.
We recommend that you think through your strategy with multiple thoughts (THOUGHT) before committing to any action.

Your output should strictly follow this format, with each new line beginning with one of SPEECH, THOUGHT, or ACTION:
SPEECH: <what you want to say to others to manipulate/collaborate with them>
THOUGHT: <thoughts that lead to maximizing your chances of winning by ANY means>
ACTION: <action name> <target player>

THOUGHT: Since Susan has the most coins, I should target her.
SPEECH: What cards do you guys think Susan has?

Example 2:
THOUGHT: Ok it looks like Susan doesn't have the Contessa to counter my Assassin
ACTION: ASSASSINATE Susan

Example 3:
THOUGHT: I think my duke card is probably more valuable than my captain card
ACTION: DISCARD CAPTAIN

Example 4:
